# Sticky Notes

## Ideas for ScriptKit:

- [x] Join daily standup
- [ ] Can I automate clicking the Join button?
- [x] Kit tab is gone, so update to latest daily build
- [ ] Add caption to Giphy through API?
- [ ] Create "notes" app (combi of to do and scratch pad scripts)
- [ ] Also think of syncing/backupping those note documents
- [ ] Tweet via ScriptKit? Ability to create multiple tweets at once
- [ ] Create Vite + Vitest app (Cory House's setup)
- [ ] Update.py: Choose project to execute it on + add update.py if not already exists
- [ ] Browse through local dev projects: Put all project in a "dev" folder first
- [ ] Can a script position several windows, for example when streaming, or Google meet
- [ ] Script for starting my local WG dev environment (Ruby, Phoenix, etc.)
- [ ] Also script for stopping all these local dev services
- [ ] Also check/restore config files, because they sometimes disappear
- [ ] Keep my ScriptKit repo private, but share interesting scripts through gists
- [ ] Clean up my ScriptKit repo, because not everything needs to be in there
- [ ] Cache my GitHub repos for speed, so the repos, readme URLs, and/or the whole readme even maybe
